# Student Ads

I had been developing a web application called `Student Ads` using ASP.NET MVC for approximately two months in 2018. Unfortunately, I had to cease the implementation process due to a shift in my plan. The primary objective of this application was to establish a cohesive platform for students to advertise their products or services, akin to Kijiji or Facebook Marketplace.


## How to use the app

In order to access and execute this application, Visual Studio IDE is required as it has not been deployed anywhere yet. Additionally, a MSSQL Server database is mandatory for its proper functionality.
